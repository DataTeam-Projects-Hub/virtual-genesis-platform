# 📊 Virtual Genesis Platform Analysis

Welcome to the `virtual-genesis-platform` repository!  
This project focuses on analyzing the **early buyers ("bots")** of the **genesis token** in the Virtual Protocol ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Identify and track wallets that participated early in the genesis token launch.
- Analyze behavioral patterns of these wallets to detect potential bots.
- Create meaningful metrics and visualizations for reporting.
- Build a comprehensive dataset for future insights and dashboards.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Create an Issue** before starting any new analysis or dataset.
2. Add your work in a new folder under a clear task name (e.g., `early-wallet-detection`).
3. Push regularly and reference your GitHub issue (e.g., `closes #3`).

## 🧾 File Naming Guidelines

- Use lowercase names with hyphens (`-`)
- Keep it short, specific, and meaningful

**Examples:**
- `wallet-tracker.py`
- `genesis-bot-query.sql`
- `volume-spike-analysis.ipynb`

---

## 🔁 Collaboration Best Practices

- Maintain a **clean and structured directory** for each analysis.
- Document each task using a `README.md` inside the task folder.
- Use versioned or dated file names when needed for tracking progress.
- Avoid pushing temporary files or incomplete scripts.

By working together in this structured format, we ensure transparency, traceability, and team-wide clarity.

Let’s build reliable metrics and bring insights with clean data and sharp visuals! 🚀📈
